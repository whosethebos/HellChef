# HellChef
Android application using Java and tried to incoperate YOLO Darknet for vegetable classification.

## ML Code for HellChef
The custom training for vegetables and Darknet YOLO code is in below GITHUB. This repository contain a jupitor notebook with google drive for trained weights and dataset.

## Abstract
Object detection and recognition has been one of the challenging tasks for many years. They are many techniques involved in this process and they are used in many scenarios in the real time. Things like classroom attendance, offices, traffic, and photo tagging so on. With the help of the advanced AI technologies they are been used in Drones, self-driving cars, automation and in robots for understanding the environment. The visual aspect of classification the objects and recognition of what that object is the key aspect ratio in all these applications. Usually a traditional Convolution neural network has been used for the recognition of the objects.

In our project, we are applying CNN techniques to detect and recognize the fruits and vegetables that are available in the house and recommend the dish that can be prepared using the main key ingredients. We have many applications (app) for side chef, super cook where the recipes and other steps are present. However, the meals are present where the user select the meal then look for the ingredients. In our application the user can take the pic of the items that are available in his refrigerator or in the house, where it goes to the CNN and identify the items or ingredients and lists the recipes where the user can choose the dish they want to make. 

For Database i am using Firebase for user authentication and storage of the ingredients.
For developing android application i am using Android studio and the language used is Java.
